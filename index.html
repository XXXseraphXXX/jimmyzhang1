        <p> welcome to this website where everything here will be about me. First off I think we will be talking about is what I like to do. what i like to do is playing league of legend. Since the beginning I was alway interested in the game World of warcarft, but I could never understand it that why I started out playing league because it was a bit easier to follow the concert of it compare to Wow. Furthermore, I really enjoy the community that it present even though some of them were toxic. However this year I really hope I can learn as must as possible, so one day I can work at Riot Game or Epic game.
